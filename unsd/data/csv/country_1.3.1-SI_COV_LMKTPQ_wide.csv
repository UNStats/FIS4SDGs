Therefore, country program information on country SPL programs included in ASPIRE is limited to what is captured by the respective national household surveys only and does not necessarily represent the universe of programs. In addition, the availability of ASPIRE indicators depends on the type of questions included in the survey.

However, household surveys have the unique advantage of allowing analysis of program impact on household welfare. With such caveats in mind, ASPIRE indicators based on household surveys provide an approximate measure of social protection systems performance. 
Generally, ASPIRE indicators are based on a first level analysis of original household survey data (with no imputations) and on a unified methodology that does not necessarily reflect country-specific knowledge and in depth country analysis relying on administrative program level data.
